  <h1>The Queen of Dragons</h1>
  <p>
    Daenerys Targaryen, known as the Queen of Dragons, is one of the most iconic figures in 
    the world of Westeros. Born on Dragonstone, she rose from exile to become a powerful 
    leader who inspired loyalty and fear. Her journey was marked by resilience, compassion, 
    and ambition. She freed countless slaves across Essos, earning the title “Breaker of Chains.” 
    With her three dragons—Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion—she embodied the ancient Valyrian 
    heritage of House Targaryen. Daenerys sought to reclaim the Iron Throne and restore her 
    family’s legacy, becoming a symbol of hope and destiny across the Seven Kingdoms.
